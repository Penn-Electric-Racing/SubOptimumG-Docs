Contributing
====================

Follow the development set-up instructions under :doc:`installation <installation>`.


Workflow
***********

    1. Create a new branch for your features.
    2. Make your changes, commit, then open a Pull Request on Github. Please make sure your Pull Requests have sufficiently detailed descriptions, and include any critical changes/issues to take note of.
    3. Request a review from Software/Vehicle Dynamics leads. Follow up after reviews
    4. Before you merge, preferably rebase your branch on main and resolve conflicts locally for a clean commit history.

Style
***********

    * `black` for code formatting
    * `pytest` for unit testing
    * `update-dependencies.yml` & `dependabot` for automatically updating dependencies

.. note::

   If you change any files **outside** of the notebooks (.py files), you need to **restart** the runtime
   of the notebook.
