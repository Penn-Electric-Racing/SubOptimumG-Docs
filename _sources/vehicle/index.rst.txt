Vehicle Model
=================

This file integrates the various subsystems. It provides a state machine representing the car, that tracks the current velocity
and acceleration of the car. It provides the logic to incrementally simulate accelerating, braking, and coasting, assuming ideal
driver behavior. The state machine is updated accordingly after each incremental action.

   <h4>Coordinate Systems</h4>

In CAD, for REV 10, the chassis/car coordinate system follows these axes:

* **Longitudinal Axis** (*+z*):
  Points from the rear to the front of the car

* **Lateral Axis** (*+x*):
  Points from the right to the left of the car

* **Vertical Axis** (*+y*):
  Points from the bottom to the top of the car

.. note::
   The coordinate system follows a right-handed convention. When referencing directions, the driver's perspective is assumed as the default reference point.

.. math::

   \begin{align*}
   +z &\rightarrow \text{longitudinal} \\
   +x &\rightarrow \text{lateral} \\
   +y &\rightarrow \text{vertical}
   \end{align*}
