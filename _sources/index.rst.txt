SubOptimumG - FSAE Competition Simulator
=========================================

SubOptimumG is a Formula SAE Competition Simulator designed to model and analyze vehicle performance in FSAE
events. This is a GGV-based point mass 4-tire lap simulation that runs every competition event to determine
high-level car parameters. This sim assumes instantaneous weight transfer (i.e., no suspension) and contains a
Tire friction circle fitted to TTC data.
