=========================================

SubOptimumG is a 4-tire Vehicle Dynamics simulation used to analyze performance with respect to FSAE events.
It models the car as a point mass with instantaneous weight transfer (i.e. no suspension) and incorporates a
tire friction ellipse fitted to TTC data.
